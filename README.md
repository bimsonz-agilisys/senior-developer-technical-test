# Agilisys (CXM) Senior Web Developer Technical Test
The tasks outlined as part of this exercise are designed to help you
showcase your technical problem-solving abilities in a near real-world
scenario. 

All parts of the development lifecycle will be assessed as
Part of this assignment. From GIT competence and time management to solution 
design, implementation and testing.

# Getting Started
- Clone this repository, think of it as your sandbox for this project.
- Each empty directory included in this repo should be treated as an
independent repo, it should serve as the project root for each application.
- You should spend no more than 2 hours on this exercise, use it wisely.

# The Problem
The client manages a catalog of personalised number plates. They want a simple
but modern web application that allows customers to search for desired number plates.

As well as customer access, staff also need access to a backend interface
to allow them to view their entire catalog.

# The Solution
While the implementation of this solution is down to you, there are some things
we'd like to see;
- A REST API (Producer, PHP)
- A Frontend application (Typescript)
- Backend application (Consumer, PHP)
- Strong understanding and implementation of object-oriented programming concepts
(Nothing is overkill when comes to demonstrating understanding)
- Testable, extendable code.

Work though the above as an order of priority.

# Considerations
- In the real world we use frameworks to speed up development, we are happy for
you to do so here. You won't be judged on your choice or implementation as long
as they are fit for purpose. They should however only be used to facilitate 
your custom development not used for providing custom functionality. (Our 
stack currently consists of Drupal + React but appropriate alternatives are fine)
- Database design and development is NOT part of this assessment, we have
provided a dataset in JSON format in the root of this repo. Use that in place
of a database but ensure the design allows for this to be easily swapped out 
for a database later in the application's lifecycle.
- Authentication comes in many shapes and sizes, with that in mind it can be
left out of this solution.
